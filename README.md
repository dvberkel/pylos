Pylos is a game by David G. Royffe produced by [Gigamic][gigamic]. The description reads

> Simple rules, quick rounds and rather subtle tactics: Pylos is one of the strangest yet
most beautiful abstract games on the market today, and winner of several “Game of the
Year” awards around the world. The object is to save your marbles so that you can be
the one to place a marble at the very top of the pyramid. Pylos is irresistibly attractive
as both a game and a decorative object.
